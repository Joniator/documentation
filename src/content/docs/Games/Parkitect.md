Syncthing syncs the game and mods with my local installation. 
The main game will be synced one way, mods sync both ways, if you install a mod, everyone has it.

[Download Syncthing here](https://syncthing.net/)

## Add my device

- Open Syncthing
- Under `Remote Devices → Add Remote Device`
- Add my UID `ZPRVXDV-I4COGOD-3ASTIVF-ZNWJFJL-P2T33IZ-YH2SBDK-VXPP4GC-2SZ3FAG`

## Add the Parkitect-Shares

-   Send me a PM with your `Device Name`, and I'll send you the shares.
-   You'll get a notification in Syncthing, accept the shares.
-   Change the `Folder Path `for both shares:
    -   Parkitect: This will share the game installation files, put it in a folder with your other games.   
        E.g. `C:\Games\Parkitect`
    -   Start the `Launch Parkitect` shortcut from the newly synced folder, so the game creates your config files.
    -   Parkitect Mods: This includes all mods that are synced. Parkitect stores them in your Documents, in a Folder `Parkitect\Mods`. This depends on your username and if you use OneDrive.   
        E.g `C:\Users\<Usernam>\Dokumente\Parkitect\Mods`
