Download [Amethystcraft.zip](https://cloud.boeller.dev/s/W5YbL2Tad8Zb62d/download/Amethystcraft.zip), and [import it into PrismLauncher](prism.md).  
Change the settings to the correct Java version, for Amethystcraft 1.20 that would be Java 17.  
After launching the modpack, it will check for updates, and download all mods, resource packs and shaders. 

:::note[Playing on the server]
The official Amethystcraft Server will be listed in the server list. If not, you can connect to `jonnyb.name`

## Updates

Every new start, the modpack checks for updates and downloads them automatically. 
If something goes wrong, you can just import the pack again, copy your worlds/settings, and delete the old one.

## Playing on the server

You get a sharestone and some food when first joining the server. Place the sharestone once you found a home, and give it a name so everyone knows whos sharestone it is. You can use them to teleport between sharestones of the same color.
