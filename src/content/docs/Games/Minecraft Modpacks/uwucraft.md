## PrimsLauncher

If not done yet, [install PrismLauncher](prism.md).

Download [UwUcraft.zip](https://github.com/tazedclub/UwUCraft/raw/main/UwUcraft-1.20.zip), and [import it into PrismLauncher](prism.md).  
Change the settings to the correct Java version, for UwUcraft 1.20 that would be 1.17.  
After launching the modpack, it will check for updates, and download all mods, resource packs and shaders. 

!!! note "Playing on a server"
    The official UwUcraft Server will be listed in the server list. If not, you can connect to `uwucraft.tzd.one`

## Updates

Every new start, the modpack checks for updates and downloads them automatically. 
If something goes wrong, you can just import the pack again, copy your worlds/settings, and delete the old one.
