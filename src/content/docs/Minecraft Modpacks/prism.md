## Install PrismLauncher
To manage the modpacks, you can (and should) use PrismLauncher.  
It can be downloaded [here.](https://prismlauncher.org/download)

## Install Java
Depending on the Minecraft version, you also need to install the right java version.  
[You can find the download links to Java here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/), and the required version in the table below.

Install the Java version somewhere you remember.  
I install them in the same folder as PrismLauncher, in `PrismLauncher/java/java21` etc..

| Minecraft     | Java
| --            | --
| 1.21+         | Java 21
| 1.18 - 1.19   | Java 17

Once you installed PrismLauncher, point it to your installed java version: `java/java21/bin/java.exe`  

:::note
Remember to select the correct version for each modpack. You can change the version in `Pack > Edit > Settings > Java installation` and select the correct one.
